## Informal rover Roadmap

This is an informal project roadmap list of items needing attention and help:

### Pre-Release Roadmap

These items need attention before the first release is possible:

1. Investigate meta/grouped, commands/aliases and a better one-liner story
2. Add CLI flags for upload options
3. Build/update release system scripting that produces results compatible with GH releases

### Post-Release Roadmap

Here are some goals for after initial release.

1. Encrypt archive with PGP
2. Implement additional command core packages:
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - NGINX
  - PostgreSQL
  - Redis
  - Whatever runtime thing makes sense
